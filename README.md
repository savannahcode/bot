### For fully functional slash commands, there are three important pieces of code that need to be written. They are:

- The individual command files, containing their definitions and functionality.
- The command handler, which dynamically reads the files and executes the commands.
- The command deployment script, to register your slash commands with Discord so they appear in the interface.
